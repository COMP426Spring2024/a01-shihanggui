                <p>When the earth was still young, there were ten suns in the sky. It was extremely hot all the time and
                    there was no such thing as night.
                    The extreme heat made it hard to farm crops and endangered entire populations.

                    One day, a skilled archer named Hou Yi decided that enough was enough. He raised his bow to the
                    heavens
                    and shot down nine of the ten suns.
                    To reward him for his heroic deeds, the goddess Xiwangmu gave him an elixir of immortality, a prize
                    typically reserved for immortals who had
                    achieved enlightenment.
                    Chang'e soon discovered her husband's gift and began to devise a plan. That night, she found the
                    elixir
                    under their bed and drank every last drop.
                    Realizing that his wife was not in bed with him, Hou Yi ran outside to find her drifting into the
                    night
                    sky.<br><br>
                    Hou Yi was so angry that he grabbed his bow and tried to shoot Chang'e down; he missed every shot.
                    As
                    time went by, Hou Yi's anger subsided and he began
                    to miss his wife. He would often stare up at the moon and think about how lonely Chang'e must be. In
                    the
                    hopes that it might make Chang'e feel less alone
                    (and to show that he was no longer mad at her), Hou Yi started leaving her favorite desserts and
                    fruits
                    out every night. He continued this practice until
                    the day he died. This tradition continues today, as many people leave annual offerings to Chang'e
                    during
                    the Mid-Autumn Festival.

                    In Journey to the West by Wu Cheng'en, the pig demon, Zhu Baijie is punished for flirting with 
                    Chang'e on a cloudless night. Once the heavenly commander of the Jade Emperor's naval forces, 
                    Zhu Baijie is stripped of his post and banished to the mortal realm as a demon for his amorous 
                    advances towards the moon goddess.
