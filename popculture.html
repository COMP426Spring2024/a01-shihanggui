        <h1>Chang'e in Pop Culture</h1>

    <div class="popParagraph">
        One of the biggest holidays in the lunar calendar, the Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated throughout Eastern and
        South Eastern Asia. The festival is also considered a harvest holiday, as wheat and rice are usually harvested
        close around the time festivities occur. The festival is a special time where people can reflect on the past
        year with family, friends, and food.
        <br><br>
        During the Mid-Autumn Festival, people will commonly place fruits and sweets on open air altars for Chang'e to
        bless. Mooncakes, often decorated with motifs of Chang'e and her pet rabbit, are a common treat that people
        enjoy during the holiday.
        <br><br>
        Chang'e's myth has also been referenced on lunar exploration missions. When the astronauts of Apollo 11 landed
        on the moon, flight controller Ronald Evans told Michael Collins the story of Chang'e and how she lived on the
        moon with a white rabbit. Collins replied that he would keep an eye out for the “bunny girl”.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (CLEP), is called the Chang'e Project. Run by the
        Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA), the project focuses on a series of robotic missions that hope to
        develop a deeper understanding of the lunar surface and eventually establish a lunar research station.
